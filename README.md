# DiallelX
*DiallelX* is a CPU-oriented modern fortran program to approximate Network Cross-Correlation coefficients (NCCs) among multiple continuous records and template waveforms observed at multiple seismic stations. The results, relatively less accurate but sufficient to find new seismic events, are obtained several-fold faster than a conventional scheme.
